        data-aos-easing="ease-in-sine">Indus is
        one of the few schools that goes beyond academics, catering to students’
        signature strengths. Here arts, crafts,
        music, dance, drama and physical eduaction are given as much importance
        as academics. The Leadership Curriculum,
        unique to Indus, allows for students to set skill-based goals in several
        areas. We believe that skill
        development is absolutely essential to prepare students for life. All of
        these aspects provide for Whole
        Education. Through these features we aim to teach skills that would
        prepare students for the VUCA (volatility,
        uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity) world that lies ahead of them</span>

        uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity) world that lies ahead of them. Indus is also the only School that has a

      We strongly emphasize the holistic development of a child. This journey
      begins in the early years by nurturing
      competencies and skills as listed below :</span>

      data-aos-easing="ease-in-sine">
      Children don't simply observe the world, they also imagine how it could be
      different, hence the concept of Tikkun Olam or heal the world, nurtures
      empathy and also gives them a personal
      vision. The vision is decided by the child and facilitated by teachers and
      parents.</span>

      data-aos-easing="ease-in-sine">Is an
      approach that helps develop perspective thinking, builds character,
      morals, and values; and also fosters moral
      imagination. Reflecting on fictional or nonfictional stories, can be a
      powerful force to get children to engage
      with a character’s life and emotions, cultivating empathy.</span>

      Einstein said, "Imagination is more important than knowledge", because
      imagination opens the door to creativity
      and innovation. This can be achieved through the Israeli concept of a
      Junkyard. When children play with each other
      with junk, household items and scrap materials; they manipulate materials,
      express themselves verbally and
      non-verbally, plan, act, interact, react, and try different roles. This
      encourages them to become independent
      thinkers, risk takers, decision makers and also conflict resolvers.</span>

      With the advent of technology, students are spending most of the time
      indoors and are experiencing a nature
      deficit disorder. Reconnecting with nature (Biophilia) is another way to
      foster empathy, a sense of
      responsibility, resilience and also creativity. The benefits of connecting
      with nature are immense - it fosters
      their intellect though inquiry and experimentation - bringing out the
      scientist in them.

      The curriculum encourages children to ask questions, plan investigations,
      explore various outcomes, and reach
      logical conclusions, with teachers as facilitators. For older children
      from ages 4 to 6 the curriculum has a
      strong focus on conceptual learning and development of leadership skills.
      Children engage in a transdisciplinary
      curriculum that meets international benchmarks.

        students, helping them value their talent to
        ultimately unlock their potential. Knowledge acquired from the
        classrooms to a large extent augments practical
        understanding. The main agenda of the leadership curriculum is to
        connect the children to society, to the
        environment, and most importantly to themselves.</span>

        data-aos-easing="ease-in-sine">Leadership is experiential and
        transformational. However, experiences are quite
        meaningless unless one reflects on them and learns something from them.
        Reflection is an art and a science. At
        Indus school of leadership, during their annual leadership camp,
        students are trained to reflect through
        outbound activities.</span>
