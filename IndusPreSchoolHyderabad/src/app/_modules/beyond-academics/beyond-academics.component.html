        The 21st century is characterized by a dizzying pace and enormous
        competition. A need for a shift from whole child development to holistic
        education. Indus helps students handle the challenges through a
        well-designed curriculum that is a right mix of academics and character
        building. It is the education of the heart and mind, and not the head
        alone. Indus is one of the few schools that goes beyond academics,
        catering to students’ signature strengths, teaching the child to unlock
        his potential. The curriculum is designed such that our students become
        whole people and independent learners, who will be self-motivated to
        seek knowledge. Knowledge at Indus is not merely about natural sciences,
        social sciences and the arts, true knowledge is experiential and
        transformational. Preparation for life is the purpose of education.

        central philosophy of the school is based on the concept of
        ‘Leadership’, that focusses on child’s mind, body and spirit. Our
        leadership programme is based on certain ‘Keys to leadership’ which
        include aspects like Life-long learning. Values, Communication,
        Innovation and Thinking. The leadership curriculum at Indus focuses on
        the self-actualization of students, helping them value their talent to
        ultimately unleash their potential. Knowledge acquired from the
        classrooms to a large extent augments practical understanding. The main
        agenda of the leadership curriculum is to connect the children to
        society, to the environment, and most importantly to themselves.
        However, experiences are quite meaningless unless one reflects on them
        and learns something from them. Reflection is an art and a science. At
        Indus school of leadership, during their annual leadership camp,
        students are trained to reflect through outbound activities.
