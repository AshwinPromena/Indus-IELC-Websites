    <span class="fs-small text-a-j" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400" data-aos-easing="ease-in-sine">The aim of
      the IELC curriculum is to provide a transdisciplinary
      curriculum which is engaging, exciting, challenging and relevant to the
      children, who fall into the age bracket of one to six years. It focuses on
      the whole growth of the developing child, touching hearts as well as minds
      and encompassing social, physical, emotional, cognitive and cultural needs
      in addition to academic development. At IELC, our IB inspired curriculum
      or program prepares children to become active, caring, lifelong learners
      who demonstrate respect for themselves and others and have the capacity to
      participate in life and the world around them. It focuses on the
      development of the whole child as an inquirer, both within and beyond the
      classroom.</span>
    <span class="fs-small text-a-j" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400" data-aos-easing="ease-in-sine">At Indus we
      believe that every child is altruistic and has the potential
      to change the world, for the better. We strongly emphasize the holistic
      development of a child. This journey begins in the early years by
      nurturing competencies and skills as listed below:</span>
    <span class="fs-md text-primary fw-600 ls-1" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300"
      data-aos-easing="ease-in-sine">1) Tikkun Olam</span>
    <span class="fs-small text-a-j" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400" data-aos-easing="ease-in-sine">
      Children don't simply observe the world, they also imagine how it could be
      different, hence the concept of Tikkun Olam or heal the world, nurtures
      empathy and also gives them a personal vision. The vision is decided by
      the child and facilitated by teachers and parents.</span>
    <span class="fs-md text-primary fw-600 ls-1" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300"
      data-aos-easing="ease-in-sine">2) Deep Reading</span>
    <span class="fs-small text-a-j" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400" data-aos-easing="ease-in-sine">Is an
      approach that helps develop perspective thinking, builds character,
      morals, and values; and also fosters moral imagination. Reflecting on
      fictional or nonfictional stories, can be a powerful force to get children
      to engage with a character’s life and emotions, and cultivating
      empathy.</span>
    <span class="fs-md text-primary fw-600 ls-1" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300"
      data-aos-easing="ease-in-sine">3) Junk Yard Philosophy</span>
    <span class="fs-small text-a-j" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400" data-aos-easing="ease-in-sine">
      Einstein said, "Imagination is more important than knowledge", because
      imagination opens the door to creativity and innovation. This can be
      achieved through the Israeli concept of a Junkyard. When children play
      with each other with junk, household items and scrap materials; they
      manipulate materials, express themselves verbally and non-verbally, plan,
      act, interact, react, and try different roles. This encourages them to
      become independent thinkers, risk takers, decision makers and also
      conflict resolvers.</span>
    <span class="fs-md text-primary fw-600 ls-1" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300"
      data-aos-easing="ease-in-sine">4) Biophilia</span>
    <span [id]="contentView" class="fs-small text-a-j" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400"
      data-aos-easing="ease-in-sine" id="hello">
      With the advent of technology, students are spending most of the time
      indoors and are experiencing a nature deficit disorder. Reconnecting with
      nature (Biophilia) is another way to foster empathy, a sense of
      responsibility, resilience and also creativity. The benefits of connecting
      with nature are immense - it fosters their intellect through inquiry and
      experimentation - bringing out the scientist in them. The curriculum
      encourages children to ask questions, plan investigations, explore various
      outcomes, and reach logical conclusions, with teachers as facilitators.
      For older children from ages 4 to 6 the curriculum has a strong focus on
      conceptual learning and development of leadership

            preparation for life. The curriculum is a dynamic and an
            all-inclusive one, where students are taught to be independent,
            risk-taking inquirers. The curriculum is delivered around six
            transdisciplinary themes where they develop various attributes of IB
            Learner Profile to become internationally-minded citizens of the
            world. Students also explore design thinking through their units of
            inquiry collaboratively, formulating their questions, researching
            the answers, reflecting on their findings and taking action.</span>
          <span class="fs-small text-a-j">Our S.T.E.A.M Lab is the epicenter of harnessing knowledge gained
            in classrooms through various learning engagements and applying them
            to build models using K-Nex, Lego, 3D Pens, Circuits and 3D Printer.
            Students gain in-depth understanding of robotics, coding, Bluetooth
            technology, mathematical logic and critical thinking, giving them a
            strong foundation for an AI dominated future- a future that has
            already arrived. Our PYP Programme is for children aged 6 to 10
            years of age.</span>
