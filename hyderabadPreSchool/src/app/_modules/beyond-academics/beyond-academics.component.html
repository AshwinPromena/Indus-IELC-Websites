        is one of the few schools that goes beyond academics, catering to students’ signature strengths. Here arts,
        crafts, music, dance, drama, and sports are given as much importance as academics. The Leadership Curriculum,
        unique to Indus, allows for students to set skill-based goals in several areas. We believe that skill
        development is absolutely essential to students for life. All of these aspects provide for Whole Education. The
        Leadership Curriculum, Indus Orchestra, House Visions, Community Service Projects, inter-school tournaments, and
        inter-house competitions are just some of the opportunities provided to students. Through these features, we aim
        to teach skills that would prepare students for the VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity)
        world that lies ahead of them. Indus is also the only school that has a section in the report card on Whole
        Education, placing it on par with academics. We firmly believe in providing whole education, but not at the cost
        of academics. </span>

      <span class="fs-small text-a-j" data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="400" data-aos-easing="ease-in-sine">The leadership curriculum at Indus focuses on the self-actualization of students, helping them value their talent to ultimately unlock their potential. Knowledge acquired from the classrooms to a large extent augments practical understanding. The main agenda of the leadership curriculum is to connect the children to society, to the environment, and most importantly to themselves. Leadership is experiential and transformational. However, experiences are quite meaningless unless one reflects on them and learns something from them. Reflection is an art and a science. At Indus school of leadership, during their annual leadership camp, students are trained to reflect through outbound activities.</span>
